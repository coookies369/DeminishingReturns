# Deminishing Returns

This mod, which I apparently spelled wrong, is a mod that punishes players for going to the same few moons. Any moons which have been visited recently will have a reduced amount of scrap.

*Note: Currently the terminal will not show which moons are reduced if Termnal Formatter or Lethal Level Loader is installed. I don't know how to fix this. Send help.*

## Configs

* **DeminishedScrapMultiplier:** Multiplier for scrap amounts on deminished moons. *Default: 0.5*
* **RecentMoonCount:** How many days before a recent moon is "forgotten". *Default: 3*
* **ResetAfterQuota:** If the recent moons list should be cleared after a quota cycle. *Default: true*
