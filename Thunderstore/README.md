# Deminishing Returns

This mod, which I apparently spelled wrong, is a mod that punishes players for going to the same moons too frequently. When leaving a moon, its scrap multiplier will be reduced based on how much scrap you've collected.

## Compatibility

The mod is now compatible with LethalLevelLoader. It is not compatible with TerminalFormatter, but it will work anyway if LethalLevelLoader is also installed.
This mod is incompatible with other mods that have scrap multipliers, such as MeteoMultiplier.

## Configs

* **ResetAfterQuota:** If scrap reductions on moons should be reset after each quota cycle. *Default: false*
* **dailyRegen:** How much each moons scrap reduction should recover each day. *Default: 0.25*
